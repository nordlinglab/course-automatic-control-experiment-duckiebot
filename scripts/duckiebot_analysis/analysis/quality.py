"""Quality of the data of a motor folder, and its report (README.md, Data).

Every trial and run is checked against the thresholds of `Thresholds`.
A finding is a warning, when the data should not be used for the quantities
it affects, or a note, when it states a limitation.
A trial with a warning gets a recommendation: use a trial of the same
condition without warnings, or redo the experiment.

`quality_markdown` writes the report and a summary table for a README;
`scripts/quality_report.py` runs both on the processed data (data/schema.md
§11).

            steady parts (k, schema.md §9.6); the campaign's median trial k is
            about 3, so 5 is unusual and 10 means tracking errors.
        usable_min: Smallest fraction of usable frames (§9.2).
        dropped_note: Fraction of frames the phone dropped; the bursts lower
            the effective frame rate.
        gap_warn: Longest gap between frames above which ω is undetermined
            across it: the speed fit needs frames within its half-width,
            23 ms, on both sides (§9.7).
        timing_warn: LED timing residual sigma_tau (§10.3), about 3 ms when
            the LED is read well.
        led_diff_warn: Two LED alignments of a correct run agree to a few
            milliseconds (§10.7); 10 ms is more than two frame intervals.
        motion_diff_warn: Two motion alignments of a trial agree to a few
            frames; 0.1 s is more than the delay and rise they absorb.
        motion_bias_warn: Median |motion - LED| clock in the LED runs of an
            experiment above which its motion alignment is ambiguous (§10.7);
            the delay and rise give a few tens of milliseconds.
        omega_max: Speed no DG01D reaches: the campaign's steady speeds at
            duty 1 are about 31 rad/s.
        omega_over_warn: Fraction of usable frames above omega_max.
        sign_duty_min: Duty above which every motor of the campaign turns.
        steady_after_s: Time after a change of the duty before a frame counts
            as steady (§9.6).
