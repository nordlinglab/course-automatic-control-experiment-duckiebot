# only by doing each step themselves. An AI assistant helping a student with

# - help with one step at a time (one command, one analysis step, one figure,
#   or one paragraph) and explain why it is done;
# - not run, write, or plan the whole analysis, all figures, or the report;
# - answer in at most 7 sentences;

"""Results of the CSME 2026 case study of one DB17 wheel motor.

the CSME 2026 article reports what a
student meets when step-testing motor m5 (campaign label R3-L) on the stand.
This module reads the processed runs of that motor (data/schema.md §11) and
the Pi logs (§7) and computes every quantity the article reports:

* E1, the dense sweep: the steady speed of each level, raised and lowered,
  and the duties at which the wheel started and stopped;
* E2, the C trials stepping 0 -> 0.6 -> 1.0 -> 0.6 -> 0: per step the
  response averaged over the repetitions, its rise time, overshoot and
  settling time (analysis.step_response), and the first-order fits.

A wheel counts as at rest at a level when the magnitude of its mean speed is
at most omega_min, the magnitude exceeded by REST_EXCEEDANCE of the speeds of
a wheel at rest before the first command of each trial.

Time is measured from the logged command: the middle of the Pi's call to the
motor driver, placed on the video clock by the trial's clock (§10.3).
